# BattleShip
Classic game from childhood.
Both players add the ships to their fields one by one (no peeking!), and then start shelling each other until one of them succeeds. 
To make the game fair and prevent the players from peeping at each other's fields, after each move add the message "Press Enter and pass the move to another player",
which will clear the screen.
